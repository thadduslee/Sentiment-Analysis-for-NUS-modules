A very easy module with low workload compared with other FASS 1101E subjects. Good to take for fass students to clear the social science basket requirement. Assessment consists of mid terms (memorise the readings) + some assignments on user design + finals (memorise again). Personally I do not like memorising type of modules, but we all have to clear the basket requirements. Finals consist of multiple choice which can be done in 1 hour. Because of the easy content and assessment, this module can be very difficult to score.</p><p>Grade: B+</p>\",\n          \"<p>Module review by Denis Tan: <a href=\\\"http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchbeandecons.blogspot.sg%2F2012%2F07%2Fanother-semester-in-review.html%3A4UMTb3oGB6w4F8zGHhY-fst9Ebo&amp;cuid=3131489\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"http://chbeandecons.blogspot.sg/2012/07/another-semester-in-review.html\\\">http://chbeandecons.blogspo...</a></p><p>Taken in AY11/12 Sem 2</p><p>CN2125 is a core module for Chemical Engineers taught by Prof Wang Chi Hwa and Dr Praveen Linga. There are 2 mid-terms, 1 group project, 3 assignments and 1 final exam. The mid-terms are unbelievably easy 80% of the students scored within 2 marks of perfect score. The group project is basically to interest you in the subject further and has little bearing on the overall grade. You have full liberty to choose any topic (from heat and mass transfer) to investigate on and write a 2 page report. The final exams is very tough and will segregate the cohort according to ability. I did very well for mid-terms and assignments so i believe it was the finals that undid my good work.</p><p>Textbook is: Fundamentals of Mass, Momentum and Heat Transfer by WWWR. It is compulsory and i recommend getting it since the papers are open-book based.</p><p>Topics covered (Prof Wang):<br>1) Fundamentals of Heat Transfer<br>2) Steady State Conduction<br>3) Unsteady State Conduction<br>4) Convective Heat Transfer<br>5) Convective Heat Transfer Correlations<br>6) Boiling and Condensation<br>7) Boiling and Condensation Correlations<br>8) Molecular Mass Transfer</p><p>Topics covered (Dr Linga Praveen):<br>1) Molecular Diffusion<br>2) Convective Mass Transfer<br>3) Convective Mass Transfer Correlations<br>4) Radiation Heat Transfer</p><p>Prof Wang, who teaches 70% of the course (the entire heat transfer component), is quite possibly the clearest Professor you will ever get in NUS. He goes through his slides extremely methodically, logically linked one portion to the next. Really easy for students to understand if you pay attention to what he has to say. Dr Praveen is pretty new at this module and he teaches the mass transfer components. He pretty much teaches from the book so if you are a fast learner, you can skip his lectures.</p><p>Grade: A-</p>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"likes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 49,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 19,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          7,\n          15\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dislikes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 13,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          8,\n          1,\n          4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_approved\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"parent_comment_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1148840978.1764824,\n        \"min\": 1504826381.0,\n        \"max\": 6816014410.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1576,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6700012082.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
